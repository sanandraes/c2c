End goal: make a 4X like C2C but with more unified design, and fuller execution of the idea
What this means:
-support for multiple maps (interplanetary stuff)
-maybe chaning scope/resolution to match progress
-good scifi and implimentation of scifi
-i think this game needs more civics you feel me?
-local and national "cultural identities" as a replacement for C2C cultures and developing leader traits respectively

Current goals:
	Design Goals:
-get some idea of how research should work, web/tree/linear?
-
	Build Goals:
+find a library to work in
+get a window open with a graphic
+build something that can render a map
-get viewport working
	-be able to pan the viewport and have more map than screen
		!you can leave the universe, it gets weird
		!holding the buttons down doesn't work
		
	-be able to zoom out/in
?how should we handle terrain architecturally


-build a basic update loop and impliment some interactivity with the map (mouseover tooltip i suppose?)
--At this point we can start branching out.
