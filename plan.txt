End goal: make a 4X like C2C but with more unified design, and fuller execution of the idea
What this means:
-support for multiple maps (interplanetary stuff)
-maybe chaning scope/resolution to match progress
-good scifi and implimentation of scifi
-i think this game needs more civics you feel me?
-local and national "cultural identities" as a replacement for C2C cultures and developing leader traits respectively

A few more bitesize things to do since this is big:
-be able to generate a small map
-get something running that can handle one city and its growth and production
-get some idea of how research should work, web/tree/linear?
